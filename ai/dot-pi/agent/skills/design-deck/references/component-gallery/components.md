## Accordion

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/accordion/)

**Also known as:** Arrow toggle  ·  Collapse  ·  Collapsible sections  ·  Collapsible  ·  Details  ·  Disclosure  ·  Expandable  ·  Expander  ·  ShowyHideyThing

A vertically stacked set of collapsible sections — each heading toggles between showing a short label and revealing the full content beneath it.

**Best practices:**
- Use for long-form content that benefits from progressive disclosure
- Keep headings concise and scannable — they are the primary navigation
- Allow multiple sections open simultaneously unless space is critically limited
- Include a subtle expand/collapse icon (chevron) aligned consistently on the right
- Animate open/close with a short ease-out transition (150–250 ms)
- Ensure keyboard navigation: Enter/Space toggles, arrow keys move between headers

**Common layouts:**
- FAQ page with stacked question/answer pairs
- Settings panel with grouped preference sections
- Sidebar filter groups in e-commerce or dashboards
- Mobile navigation with expandable menu sections

---

## Alert

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/alert/)

**Also known as:** Notification  ·  Feedback  ·  Message  ·  Banner  ·  Callout

A prominent message used to communicate important information or status changes to the user.

**Best practices:**
- Use semantic color coding: red for errors, amber for warnings, green for success, blue for info
- Include a clear, actionable message — not just a status label
- Provide a dismiss action for non-critical alerts
- Position inline alerts close to the relevant content, not floating arbitrarily
- Use an icon alongside color to ensure accessibility for color-blind users
- Keep alert text to one or two sentences maximum

**Common layouts:**
- Top-of-page banner for system-wide announcements
- Inline form validation message beneath an input field
- Toast notification stack in the bottom-right corner
- Contextual warning inside a card or settings section

---

## Avatar

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/avatar/)

A visual representation of a user, typically displayed as a photo, illustration, or initials.

**Best practices:**
- Support three sizes: small (24–32 px), medium (40–48 px), large (64–80 px)
- Fall back gracefully: image → initials → generic icon
- Use a subtle ring or border to separate the avatar from its background
- For groups, stack avatars with a slight overlap and a '+N' overflow indicator
- Ensure the image is loaded lazily with a placeholder shimmer

**Common layouts:**
- User profile header with name and role
- Comment thread with avatar beside each message
- Team member list with stacked avatar group
- Navigation bar user menu trigger

---

## Badge

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/badge/)

**Also known as:** Tag  ·  Label  ·  Chip

A compact label that sits within or near a larger component to convey status, category, or other metadata.

**Best practices:**
- Keep badge text to one or two words — they are labels, not sentences
- Use a limited palette of badge colors mapped to clear semantics
- Ensure sufficient contrast between badge text and background (WCAG AA minimum)
- Use pill shape (fully rounded corners) for status badges, rounded rectangles for tags
- Avoid overusing badges — if everything is badged, nothing stands out

**Common layouts:**
- Status indicator on a table row (Active, Pending, Archived)
- Tag cloud beneath a blog post or product card
- Notification count on a nav icon
- Feature label on a pricing tier card

---

## Breadcrumbs

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/breadcrumbs/)

**Also known as:** Breadcrumb trail

A trail of links that shows where the current page sits within the site's navigational hierarchy.

**Best practices:**
- Show the full hierarchy path; truncate middle segments on mobile with an ellipsis menu
- The current page should be the last item and should not be a link
- Use a subtle separator (/ or ›) with adequate spacing
- Place breadcrumbs near the top of the content area, below the header
- Keep breadcrumb text lowercase or sentence-case for readability

**Common layouts:**
- E-commerce category → subcategory → product page
- Documentation site section navigation
- Dashboard drill-down from overview to detail view
- File manager path display

---

## Button

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/button/)

An interactive control that triggers an action — submitting a form, opening a dialog, toggling visibility.

**Best practices:**
- Establish a clear visual hierarchy: primary (filled), secondary (outlined), tertiary (text-only)
- Use verb-first labels: 'Save changes', 'Create project', not 'Okay' or 'Submit'
- Minimum touch target of 44×44 px; desktop buttons at least 36 px tall
- Show a loading spinner inside the button during async actions — disable to prevent double-clicks
- Limit to one primary button per visible viewport section
- Ensure focus ring is visible and high-contrast for keyboard users

**Common layouts:**
- Form footer with primary action right-aligned and secondary action left-aligned
- Hero CTA button centered or left-aligned beneath headline

---

## Button group

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/button-group/)

**Also known as:** Toolbar

A container that groups related buttons together as a single visual unit.

**Best practices:**
- Group only related actions — unrelated buttons should be separated
- Visually connect buttons with shared border or tight spacing (1–2 px gap)
- Clearly indicate the active/selected state in toggle-style groups
- Keep the group to 2–5 buttons; more options warrant a dropdown or overflow menu

**Common layouts:**
- Text editor toolbar (bold, italic, underline)
- View switcher (grid view, list view)
- Segmented date range selector (Day, Week, Month)
- Split button with primary action and a dropdown for alternatives

---

## Card

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/card/)

**Also known as:** Tile

A self-contained content block representing a single entity such as a contact, article, or task.

**Best practices:**
- Use a single, clear visual hierarchy within each card: media → title → meta → action
- Keep cards a consistent height in grid layouts — use line clamping for variable text
- Make the entire card clickable when it represents a navigable entity
- Use subtle elevation (shadow) or a border — not both simultaneously
- Limit card content to essential info; let the detail page carry the rest

**Common layouts:**
- Product grid with image, title, price, and CTA
- Blog post feed with thumbnail, headline, excerpt, and date
- Dashboard KPI cards with metric, delta, and sparkline
- Team member directory with avatar, name, and role

---

## Carousel

[Browse real examples →](https://component.gallery/components/carousel/)

**Also known as:** Content slider

A component that cycles through multiple content slides, navigable via swipe, scroll, or button controls.

- Support swipe gestures on touch devices
- Auto-advance only if the user hasn't interacted; pause on hover/focus
- Show a peek of the next slide to signal scrollability

- Product image gallery on a detail page
- Testimonial carousel with quote, author, and avatar
- Horizontal scrolling feature highlights in a mobile app

---

- Underline links in body text for discoverability; nav links may rely on context
- Use a distinct color from surrounding text (but avoid pure blue if it clashes with your palette)

- Always provide a clear close mechanism: X button, Cancel, and Escape key
- Trap focus within the modal while it's open for accessibility

## Popover
